== Task

Learn how to start working with Geth

* Download Geth
* Start Geth node
* Deploy a contract
* Work with Geth JavaScript console
* Subscribe to Geth events

== Steps

. Get Geth client sources and compile
+
Geth sources are available at github at https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
cd go-ethereum
make geth
----
+
After succesful compilation the Geth binaries can be found at `build/bin/`
+
[source,bash]
----
export PATH=$PATH:"$PWD/build/bin"
----
+
NOTE: the recommended steps to build on various OS are in the documentation at https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth#build-go-ethereum-from-source-code
+
. Start Geth client on localhost
+
To start the Geth and then to "play" with the private network we need
+
.. To create an account(s) that can be pre-funded and used for transfers and contract calls
(see https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/managing-your-accounts)
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir data
DATADIR="$PWD/data"
geth account new --datadir "$DATADIR" --password <(echo 'P422wORd')
# note down the public address of the created key

# each account created stores a key in keystore under $DATADIR 
tree "$DATADIR"/keystore
----
+
NOTE: Supplying the password directly as part of the command line is not recommended
+
.. To define a genesis block and define the balance of the accounts
+
The genesis block is a `json` configuration that can be generated with `puppeth` binary
or copied as it is as an example from https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/private-network#creating-the-genesis-block[documentation].
+
[source,bash]
----
./puppeth --network=myprivatenetwork
# console asks interactively about actions to take
# we want only the genesis block being generated

...

INFO [...] Administering Ethereum network           name=myprivatenetwork
WARN [...] No previous configurations found         path=$HOME/.puppeth/myprivatenetwork

What would you like to do? (default = stats)
 1. Show network stats
 2. Configure new genesis
 3. Track new remote server
 4. Deploy network components

What would you like to do? (default = create)
 1. Create new genesis from scratch
 2. Import already existing genesis
> 1

Which consensus engine to use? (default = clique)
 1. Ethash - proof-of-work
 2. Clique - proof-of-authority
> 1

Which accounts should be pre-funded? (advisable at least one)
> 0x72B152b9cCC40BE2a04F4075a1457cF8f753F7c9      
> 0x

Should the precompile-addresses (0x1 .. 0xff) be pre-funded with 1 wei? (advisable yes)
> n

Specify your chain/network ID if you want an explicit one (default = random)
> 
INFO [...] Configured new genesis block 

What would you like to do? (default = stats)
 1. Show network stats
 2. Manage existing genesis
 3. Track new remote server
 4. Deploy network components
> 2

 1. Modify existing configurations
 2. Export genesis configurations
 3. Remove genesis configuration
> 2

Which folder to save the genesis specs into? (default = current)
  Will create myprivatenetwork.json, myprivatenetwork-aleth.json, myprivatenetwork-harmony.json, myprivatenetwork-parity.json
> data/genesis
INFO [...] Saved native genesis chain spec          path=data/genesis/myprivatenetwork.json

We defined the 'proof-of-work' to be used and made the address of the created
account to be pre-funded.
+
The configuraiton of the genesis block is exported under `data/genesis`
(`puppeth` stores the configuration under `$HOME/.puppeth/myprivatenetwork`).
.. Initialize Geth with the genesis block configuration
+
[source,bash]
----
geth init --datadir "$DATADIR" "$DATADIR"/myprivatenetwork.json
----

NOTE: as a shortcut of running geth at localhost one may use
`geth --dev`

. Connect to JavaScript console of the started Geth node

[source,bash]
----
# via HTTP RPC
geth attach http://localhost:8545
# or via local IPC (inter-process-communication)
geth attach "$DATADIR/geth.ipc"

. Create a simple Solidity contract that emit log events

`EchoContract` is available at link:./contracts/EchoContract.sol
+
. Build the contract

More details on building the Solidity contracts at https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html
+
[source,bash]
----
docker run -v $PWD/contracts:/sources ethereum/solc:stable -o /sources/output --abi --bin /sources/EchoContract.sol

NOTE: mounting the volume with `podman` may throw `what():  boost::filesystem::status: Permission denied` use `:Z`
      at `-v $PWD/contracts:/sources:Z`
+
Compilation output can be found at directory `contracts/output`.
+
. Deploy contract
+
You can use https://medium.com/mercuryprotocol/dev-highlights-of-this-week-cb33e58c745f[Geth]
or use some GUI like https://remix.ethereum.org[Remix Ethereum] for the same task.

. Send a transaction to the contract to call it

+
. Subscribe to log events
+
One can use a the https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#eth_newfilter[JSONRPC API] (a stateless, remote procedure call protocol)
or the https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/pubsub[pub/sub subscription] to listen to log events in Geth.
+
NOTE: You can see the https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/v1.10.9/eth/filters/api.go#L298[Geth sources] where
the filter creation done.
+
.. Pub/Sub WebSocket notification
+
We can go with JSON-RPC notifications connecting via websockets.
As an example we can be listening to mined log events. Geth default WS port is `8546`.

[NOTE]
====
The log shows the event emitted from link:./contracts/EchoContract.sol[`Echo` contract].
First topic is the name of the function hashed with https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html[`keccac-256`].

`keccac_256("Echo(address,uint256)")` resutls in hash `030cacc26fa09af329d921d39728c2e63d3e54b638293f4d3d4b474dd96750f3`
 which is the value of the topic value.
 
 The second value `0x00000000000000000000000072b152b9ccc40be2a04f4075a1457cf8f753f7c9` is the
 `from` address padded to 32 bytes with `0`s.

The data contains the value of the `counter` variable as a hex number `0x30` is `printf %d '0x30'` which is 48.
====
+
In the similar way we can listen to the logs from the Geth console with the `eth` object.
+
[source,bash]
----
geth attach http://localhost:8485

eth.filter("pending", function(err,txn) { console.log('Pending txn: ' + txn);})
eth.filter("latest", function(err,block) { console.log('Latest block: ' + block);})
